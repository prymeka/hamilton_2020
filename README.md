### A study on the properties of fractal electronic quantum systems

Recent developments in technology allow us to control matter on the nano-scales.  This enabledthe  creation  and  study  of  electronic  quantum  systems  (EQS).  Artificial  atomic  lattices  allow  formore precise and complex systems to be realised in experiments, which includes non-integer/fractalsystems.  In this project, we have computationally modelled and analysed the electronic propertiesof a system with the geometry of three variations of the Sierpinski triangles fractal using Python.
